1. Problem Statement
Admins and managers face difficulties managing users, groups, and roles
efficiently.
Manual updates cause inconsistent permissions, delayed access approvals, and
security risks.
Without automation and clear workflows, access control becomes error-prone
and time-consuming.
The project focuses on automating user, group, and role management using
access control policies and workflow automation.
This ensures accurate permissions, improved security, and better system
reliability.
2. Empathy Map Canvas
In this phase, the team studied how administrators handle user and role
management.
They discovered pain points like manual work, unclear access visibility, and lack
of automation.
By understanding user frustrations, the team identified the need for
streamlined workflows and automatic access validation.
The empathy map revealed key insights such as:
 Need for automation and clarity
 Challenges in maintaining access control
 Importance of security and compliance
3. Brainstorming & Idea Prioritization
Team members shared and grouped ideas under automation, security, and
efficiency.
Key ideas included workflow-based access management, ACL enforcement,
and automated role assignments.
High-priority actions focus on simplifying access control, improving security,
and reducing manual effort.
These ideas will help design a smarter, safer, and faster system for managing
users, groups, and roles.
